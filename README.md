# Piroca as a Service

Brazilians tend to give way too many names to :eggplant:. This is an effort on listing them all.

## Motivation
Common use cases for PIROCA are badwords filtering and nice typography tattoos.

Now seriously, if you feel offended, my apologies. Give me a heads up and I'll take the repo out.

## Install
```
$ npm install -g piroca
```

## Usage
```
$ piroca --help

## I Find This Offensive™
Due it's very nature, it's pretty obvious that the contents of the list may look offensive. Think of it as [shutterstock's List of Dirty, Naughty, Obscene, and Otherwise Bad Words](https://github.com/shutterstock/List-of-Dirty-Naughty-Obscene-and-Otherwise-Bad-Words), but focused on a more specific "subject".
